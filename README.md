## 1. Project Overview

In this project, we build and train a deep neural network model on the flower data set.

## 2. Technical overview:
We develop a command line app using argparse library to allow user to provide various inputs/parameters to train and make inferences on the DL model. Our model as such is a deep neural network built in Pytorch. 

This notebook is well documented and covers following aspects:
* Preprocessing of data to get it ready for training.
* Model definition, training and validation functions.
* Inference

## 3. Requirements

All of the requirements are captured in requirements.txt. 
Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
